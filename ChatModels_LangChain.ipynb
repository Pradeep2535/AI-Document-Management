The architecture is stunning, and the atmosphere is incredibly immersive.  Allow at least 2 hours, including travel time to your next destination.\\n\\n2. **Government Museum (Mid-morning/early afternoon):**  Head to the Government Museum, one of the oldest museums in India. It houses a vast collection of bronze sculptures, artifacts, and art, offering a rich insight into Tamil Nadu's history and culture. Allow at least 2 hours here.\\n\\n3. **San Thome Basilica (Afternoon):**  Visit this beautiful basilica, believed to be built over the tomb of St. Thomas the Apostle. It's a significant pilgrimage site and a stunning example of Gothic architecture.  Allow 1.5 hours.\\n\\n4. **Marina Beach (Late Afternoon):** Enjoy a relaxing stroll along Marina Beach, one of the longest urban beaches in the world. Watch the sunset, soak in the atmosphere, and perhaps enjoy some street food. Allow at least 1.5 hours.\\n\\n5. **Dinner and optional visit to a local market:** Depending on your preference, you could either have dinner near Marina Beach and enjoy the lively atmosphere, or choose a restaurant in a different area. If time permits, a quick visit to a local market like Pondy Bazaar (but be mindful of time constraints and potential traffic) could provide a glimpse into the local life.\\n\\n\\n**Important Considerations:**\\n\\n* **Traffic:** Chennai traffic can be heavy.  Factor in travel time between locations, using apps like Google Maps or Ola/Uber for real-time information.\\n* **Heat:** Chennai can be hot and humid, especially during certain times of the year.  Wear light clothing, stay hydrated, and use sunscreen.\\n* **Transportation:** Taxis, auto-rickshaws, and app-based ride services are readily available.\\n* **Food:** Chennai offers a fantastic culinary scene.  Don't miss the opportunity to sample some delicious South Indian cuisine!\\n\\n\\nThis itinerary is ambitious for a single day. You may need to prioritize based on your interests and adjust the time allotted to each location.  Enjoy your trip to Chennai!\\n\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run-bf8fc51b-26a3-469b-b7d1-e149e259f84e-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 23, 'output_tokens': 516, 'total_tokens': 539, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})"
